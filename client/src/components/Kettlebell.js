            <h2>Why Add Kettlebell Swings to Your Strength Training Program?</h2>
            <p>Kettlebells are an amazing tool to pack in your strength and conditioning arsenal.
                There are so many ways kettlebells can be used in a training regimen, but if I had 
                to pick one exercise I think everyone should do, I would hands-down choose the kettlebell swing.</p>
            <p>Kettlebell swings are a phenomenal exercise that target the entire posterior chain.</p>
            <p>They can be used for power development or as an accessory exercise for conditioning. 
                They also work a myriad of strength qualities simultaneously: grip, dynamic hip hinging, 
                thoracic spine posture, and shoulder packing of the lats. The kettlebell swing can also help 
                correct anterior pelvic tilt issues by patterning pelvic stability with hip extension.</p>
            <p>Kettlebell swings largely target the power-producing muscles of the posterior chain. 
                    Your glutes, hamstrings, lats, core, and spinal stabilizers are all actively working 
                    with this ultimate bang-for-your-buck exercise.</p>
            <p>When performed with heavy weight, the pattern of horizontal hip displacement
                translates perfectly to the skill of explosive acceleration for speed athletes â€” 
                think Olympic weightlifting, gymnastics, and sprinting. Hip power is essential for so many 
                athletic movements and heavy kettlebell swings will help develop that power output.</p>
            <p>On the conditioning end of the spectrum (lighter weight and higher volume), kettlebell swings
                will work your posterior chain without over-taxing those muscles and taking time away from your 
                running/conditioning work. They're usually just enough to get your lungs fired up in a conditioning workout.</p>
